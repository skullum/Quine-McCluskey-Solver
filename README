Quine-McCluskey Solver (Q-M from now on) aides in the minimization of Boolean Algebra Expressions by making a list of possible combinations.

This implementation is in the earliest alpha stage, please be nice.

What this program does:
  Asks for input, takes the list of minimal terms and returns
	all possible combinations that could be used for reduction.

Some limitations include:
	1. Works for <= 5 variables
	2. Does not allow for "don't care" terms

Features I hope to add (in no particular order):
	1. Ability to have any number of input variables 
	2. "Don't Care" terms
	3. GUI
	4. A covering table (determines which combinations of terms should be used)
	5. Multiple passes (as the number of variables increase sometimes Boolean Algbra Expressions can be reduced multiple times; I would like to account for that)
